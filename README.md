# Figma-Samples
Just learning to create something in Figma.

**about: Figma is a cloud-based design and prototyping tool known for its real-time collaboration features. It supports cross-platform compatibility, vector editing, prototyping, and animation. Figma includes a component system for design consistency, version history for tracking changes, and supports plugins for extended functionality. It's widely used for UI/UX design due to its accessibility, security features, and the ability to create and maintain design systems.**


I created some of the samples and those are given below:
